“Tab” behaves like “Space”, i.e. it commits the typed string followed
by a space. If the option “Enable suggestions by Tab key” is set:
“Tab” toggles the display of the candidate list. I.e. it shows the
candidate list if it was hidden and hides the candidate list if it was
shown.</td>

enabled. Enabling that option makes selecting candidates a bit easier
because the number keys 1 … 9 are closer to the fingers then F1 … F9 on
most keyboards. On the other hand, it makes completing when typing
numbers impossible and it makes typing strings which are combinations
of letters and numbers like “A4” more difficult. If digits are used as
select keys, numbers can only be typed when no candidate list is
shown. In most cases this means that numbers can only be typed when
nothing else has been typed yet and the preëdit is empty.</td>

<h2>Multilingual input</h2>

<p>ibus-typing-booster supports using more than one input
method/transliteration at the same time.</p>

<p>For example, if one uses the ibus-typing-booster engine “mr-IN”,
i.e. the engine for the Indian language Marathi, one can select one of
the Marathi input methods mr-itrans, mr-phonetic, mr-inscript, and
mr-inscript2 in the setup tool. Keys typed will be transliterated
using the selected transliteration method and looked up in the mr_IN
hunspell dictionary and the user database of previous input.</p>

<p>To add English as a second language to use at the same time, one
can use the checkbox option “Add direct input” in the setup tool. If
that option is selected, direct keyboard input is added as a second
input method and the en_GB (British English) dictionary is added as a
second dictionary in addition to the mr_IN dictionary.</p>

<p>If more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed
keys will will be transliterated with each transliteration method and
each result will be looked up in the enabled dictionaries and in the
user database of previous input.</p>

<p>That way, to type English, one does not have to switch off the
Marathi engine of ibus-typing-booster, one can just type and suitable
English candidates will show up as well in the candidate list. After
typing a few characters, Marathi input is unlikely to match English
candidates and English input is unlikely to match Marathi
candidates. This works even better after ibus-typing-booster has
learned a while from the user input because ibus-typing-booster tries
to complete the currently typed word by also using the last few words
typed before as additional information. Therefore, if the user types a
combination of words again he has already typed previously, the
prediction for the currently typed word will be much better.</p>

<p>Using the setup tool it is currently only possible to add British
English as a second language to the main language of an
ibus-typing-booster engine.</p>

<p>But internally, ibus-typing-booser already supports any combination
of input methods and dictionaries, only the setup tool is not yet able
to set this up. It can be done by setting the appropriate dconf keys
manually though.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Setting three input/transliteration methods:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/inputmethod '"mr-itrans,t-latn-post,NoIme"'</code></pre></p>

<p>sets the three transliteration methods, “mr-itrans” (Marathi Itrans),
“t-latn-post” (A postscript input method to type accented Latin
characters, e.g. typing “u"” will produce “ü”), and “NoIme” (direct
keyboard input without any transliteration).</p>

<p>Setting 3 dictionaries:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/dictionary '"mr_IN,en_GB,de_DE"'</code></pre></p>

<p>sets the Marathi, the British English,and the German dictionary.</p>
