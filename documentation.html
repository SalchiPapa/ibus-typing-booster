<h2>Adding ibus-typing-booster to your desktop</h2>

<p>
  This section assumes that you have already installed ibus-typing-booster
  either using binary packages or from source and now want to add
  an ibus-typing-booster input method to your desktop.
</p>

<p>
  The procedure to add an ibus-typing-booster input method differs
  slightly depending on which type of desktop you use, the following
  sections show the procedure for popular desktop choices.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">

<br>
<h3>When using the Gnome3 desktop</h3>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>Open the Gnome3 control center</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/open-gnome-control-center.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/open-gnome-control-center.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  First click on the panel menu in the top right corner of the desktop
  and then click on the “screwdriver and wrench” icon to open the
  Gnome3 control center.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>Open the “Region &amp; Language” settings</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/open-gnome-region-and-language-settings.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/open-gnome-region-and-language-settings.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now the Gnome3 control center has opened. Click on the
  icon for the “Region &amp; Language” settings.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>The Gnome3 “Region &amp; Language” settings</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/gnome-region-and-language-settings.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-region-and-language-settings.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now the Gnome3 “Region &amp; Language” settings dialogue has opened.
</p>
<p>
  At the bottom you see a list of input sources which have already
  been added to the desktop before. In this case there are already:
  “English (US, with euro on 5)” and “Japanese (Kana Kanji)”.  This is
  just an example of course, the list of already added input methods
  could look different for you.  The first entry, “English (US, with
  euro on 5)”, is not really an input engine, it is just a keyboard
  layout. One can see that an entry in the list of input sources is a
  keyboard layout if it does not have the icon showing two
  tooth-wheels at the right side.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended to use a keyboard layout with ibus-typing-booster
  which has a real “AltGr” key and does not just make the “AltGr” or
  “Alt” key on the right side of the space bar basically a duplicate
  of the left “Alt” key. For details,
  see <a href="#key-bindings-altgr">The “AltGr” key</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The second entry, “Japanese (Kana
  Kanji)” is an input engine, it has the icon showing two tooth wheels
  at the right side.
</p>
<p>
  Now click on the “+” button at the lower left to add another input
  source.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>The Gnome3 “Add an Input Source” dialouge</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-add-an-input-source.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Then click on the three vertical dots “⋮” to open the search entry field.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>The Gnome3 “Add an Input Source” search entry</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/gnome-add-an-input-source-search.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-add-an-input-source-search.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Type the word “booster” into the search entry field. All languages
  which are supported by ibus-typing-booster are listed now.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>The Gnome3 “Add an Input Source” “Add” button</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/gnome-add-an-input-source-add-button.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-add-an-input-source-add-button.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Scroll to the main language you want to use and select it.
  You may see typing booster engines for several variants of that
  language listed, in this example for three variants of German.
</p>
<p>
  Select the variant of typing booster you want and click the
  “Add” button at the top right.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>An ibus-typing-booster engine has been added in Gnome3</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/gnome-ibus-typing-booster-engine-added.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-ibus-typing-booster-engine-added.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now you you see an ibus-typing-booster engine listed in the “Region
  &amp; Language” dialogue of Gnome3.
</p>
<p>
  If you select it, a tooth wheel appears at the bottom right of the dialogue,
  clicking that opens the setup tool of that ibus-typing-booster engine.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>The ibus-typing-booster setup tool</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-ibus-typing-booster-setup-opened-from-region-and-language-settings.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Here you see the setup tool of that ibus-typing-booster engine where
  you can customize ibus-typing-booster according to your preferences.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>Selecting an ibus-typing-booster engine in the Gnome panel</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

        <img src="images/thumbs/gnome-select-ibus-typing-booster-in-the-panel.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now open some programs where you could type something, for example
  “gedit” or “gnome-terminal”. And activate the ibus-typing-booster
  engine you want to use in the input source menu of the Gnome panel
  as shown in this screenshot.
</p>
<p>
  When the input source menu of the Gnome panel is open and an
  ibus-typing-booster engine is selected, there is a menu entry
  “Setup” which is an quicker way to open the setup tool than going to
  the “Region &amp; Language” settings dialogue.
</p>
<p>
  Some options are also directly available in the input source menu of
  the gnome panel to have quicker access to these often used options
  than having to open the setup tool. There are also <a href="">key bindings</a>
  and <a href="">mouse bindings</a> for these frequently used options
  which are shown in the input source menu of the gnome panel as well
  as a reminder.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now type something, for example into gedit and you should see
  some suggestions for completions. 
</p>
<p>
  At the beginning, the suggestions only come from the hunspell dictionaries
  and are thus not very good yet. But ibus-typing-booster learns from your
  typing, it remembers which words you use often in which context.
  Therefore, the suggestions become much better over time.
</p>
<p>
  To switch between ibus-typing-booster and other input methods or a simple
  keyboard layout, you can use the input sources menu in the Gnome panel
  or the keyboard shortcut, which is Super+Space by default (can be changed
  in the gnome-control-center).

<h3>When using other desktops than Gnome3</h3>

<p>
  This chapter shows how to add an ibus-typing-booster input method on
  most desktops except Gnome3 and Unity. The screenshots in this
  chapter are using XFCE, but it is the same procedure on most other
  desktops and window managers as well, only Gnome3 and Unity are a
  bit special.
</p>

<p>
  First start the <code>ibus-setup</code> program (For example by
  typing <code>ibus-setup &</code> into a terminal. 
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>ibus-setup asks to start ibus-daemon</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/xfce-ibus-setup-asks-to-start-ibus-daemon.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/xfce-ibus-setup-asks-to-start-ibus-daemon.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  If <code>ibus-daemon</code> is not yet running, <code>ibus-setup</code>
  may ask whether you want to start it. In that case click on “Yes”.
</p>
<p>
  If <code>ibus-daemon</code> was not already running, you probably also want
  to make it run automatically every time when you log into your desktop.
  If you are using Fedora you can do that for most desktops and window managers
  using <code>imsettings-switch</code> like this:
</p>
<p>
  <code>imsettings-switch ibus</code>
</p>
<p>
  This will change some settings so that when you log in
  next time, <code>ibus-daemon</code> will be running and the following
  environment variables will be set:
</p>
<p>
  <code>export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus</code>
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t use Fedora and do not have the <code>imsettings-switch</code>,
  there may be some other way to start <code>ibus-daemon</code> on your
  system automatically and to set the above environment variables.
</p>
<p>
  Or you can put the above environment variables into
  your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file and start <code>ibus-daemon</code>
  from some X11 startup file or make your windowmanager start it. I am
  using the “i3” windowmanager at the moment and have added the
  line <code>exec ibus-daemon -drx</code> to
  my <code>~/.config/i3/config</code> file.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>ibus-setup user interface, “General” tab</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="images/xfce-ibus-setup-general.png">
        <img src="images/thumbs/xfce-ibus-setup-general.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  In the “General” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> you see that the
  default shortcut key to switch between input methods is “Super+Space”
  and you can change this and some other options if you like.
</p>
<p>
  Personally I like the extra property panel. Therefore, I set the
  “Show property panel” option to “Always” here.
</p>
<p>
  You probably also want the option “Show icon on system tray” switched on.
</p>
<p>
  And I usually choose a somewhat bigger font to be able to see the
  details in the emoji better.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">

        <img src="images/thumbs/xfce-ibus-setup-input-method.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now use the “Input Method” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> to add
  an ibus-typing-booster engine.
</p>
<p>
  You see a list of input sources which have already been added to the
  desktop before. In this case there are already: “English - English
  (international AltGr dead keys)” and “Japanese (Kana Kanji)”.  This
  is just an example of course, the list of already added input
  methods could look different for you.  The first entry, “English -
  English (international AltGr dead keys)”, is not really an input
  engine, it is just a keyboard layout.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended to use a keyboard layout with ibus-typing-booster
  which has a real “AltGr” key and does not just make the “AltGr” or
  “Alt” key on the right side of the space bar basically a duplicate
  of the left “Alt” key. For details,
  see <a href="#key-bindings-altgr">The “AltGr” key</a>.  By the way,
  in the “Advanced” tab of <code>ibus-setup</code> there is an option
  “Use system keyboard layout”, if this option is selected,
  ibus-typing-booster will always use the system keyboard layout,
  otherwise it will use the keyboard layout from the list of input
  methods which was used last before switching to ibus-typing-booster.
</p>
<p>
  The second entry which is already there in the list of input
  methods, “Japanese (Kana Kanji)”, is a real input engine, not a
  keyboard layout.
</p>
<p>
  Now click on the “Add” button at top right to add another input
  source.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>ibus-setup user interface, “Select an input method”</caption>

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  If you do not see the main language you want to use listed already,
  click on the three vertical dots “⋮” to open the search entry field.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">
  <caption>ibus-setup user interface “Select an input method” search entry</caption>

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now either scroll through the list or type the name of your language.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  For example, when searching for “german”, it looks as in this screenshot.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<table class="picture">

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Select your langauge, in this case “German” and scroll through the
  list of German input methods shown until you find one with “Typing
  Booster” in the name.  There maybe more than one for variants of the
  language. Select the typing booster engine for your preferred
  language variant.
</p>
<p>
  Click the “Add” button.
</p>

<p>
  Now an ibus-typing-booster engine has been added to the list of input methods
  configured and it looks as in this screenshot.
</p>
<p>
  If you select that typing-booster engine, you can click the “Preferences” button
  to open the setup tool of that typing-booster-engine.

<p>
  Now open some programs where you could type something, for example

  engine you want to use by clicking on the icon for the input methods
  in the system tray and selecting the ibus-typing-booster engine
  in the menu which opens.
</p>
<p>
  When the input method menu of system tray icon is open and an
  ibus-typing-booster engine is selected, there is a menu entry
  “Setup” which is a quicker way to open the setup tool of that

<p>
  Some options are also directly available in the input method menu of

  On the top left of this screenshot you see the “property panel”
  which shows the current status of some frequently used options which
  can also be changed by clicking on the “property panel”. The
  “property panel” also offers a button to open the setup tool of the

<h3>When using the Unity desktop on Ubuntu</h3>

<p>
  I’ll write this section soon. Ibus-typing-booster works on the Unity
  desktop as well, there are only some minor differences in how the
  setup dialogues look like.
</p>


<br class="clearboth">
<a name="key-bindings"></a>
<br>
<h2>Key bindings</h2>

<br class="clearboth">
<a name="key-bindings-altgr"></a>
<br>
<h3>The “AltGr” key</h3>
<p>
  Ibus-typing-booster does not change your keyboard layout, it just
  uses the keyboard layout which was selected last.
</p>
<p>
  As some of the key bindings in the table below use key combinations
  starting with “AltGr”, it is recommended to use a keyboard layout
  where the right “Alt” key is really an “AltGr” key and not just a
  duplicate of the left “Alt” key. If you do not have a real “AltGr”
  key, you can still use most of the key bindings in the table below but
  of course not those which start with “AltGr”.
</p>
<p>
  The standard “English (US)” keyboard layout makes the “AltGr” key on
  the right side of the space bar basically behave as a duplicate of
  the left “Alt” key. So if you like the US English layout, better use
  the keyboard layout “English (US, with euro on 5)” instead of the
  standard one. “English (US, with euro on 5)” is very similar to the
  standard “English (US)” layout but has a real “AltGr” key.
</p>
<p>
  Many (but not all) keyboard layouts for other languages different
  from US English already have a real “AltGr” key.
</p>
<p>
  You can check whether your keyboard layout has a real “AltGr” key
  with “xev”, “xev” should show you the keysym “ISO_Level3_Shift”
  when pressing the “AltGr” (right “Alt”) key and <b>not</b>
  the keysym “Alt_R”.

<h2>Multilingual input</h2>

<p>
  Ibus-typing-booster supports using more than one input
  method/transliteration and more than one dictionary at the same
  time.
</p>
<p>
  That makes it possible to write text in more than one language
  without having to switch do a different language version of
  ibus-typing-booster when switching to another language. If one
  writes often in different languages this can save a lot of input
  method switching.
</p>
<p>
  This works not only when the languages use same script (like using
  English and Spanish at the same time), it works even when the
  languages use different scripts. For example when using English
  (Latin script) and Hindi (Devanagari script) at the same time. When
  using languages with different scripts at the same time, it is
  sometimes necessary to switch the input method for the preëdit (See
  the <a href="#hindi-english">Hindi and English example</a>).  But
  even in such a more complicated case, switching is often not
  necessary, often one can select a suitable candidate without
  switching and save a lot of input method switches that way.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">
<a name="hindi-english"></a>
<br>
<h3>Example using Hindi and English at the same time</h3>

<p>
  If one uses both Hindi and English often, it is more convenient to
  setup a single engine of ibus-typing-booster to use both Hindi and
  English instead of switching between a Hindi and an English
  engine. Then one can just type in either Hindi or English and
  ibus-typing-booster will show suitable candidates automatically.

<p>
  This screenshot shows how to setup ibus-typing-booster to use Hindi
  and English at the same time. This is the setup tool for the
  ibus-typing-booster engine “hi-IN”, i.e. the engine for the Indian
  language Hindi. One can select one of the Hindi input methods
  “Enhanced Inscript” (= hi-inscript2), “Inscript” (= hi-inscript),
  “Phonetic” (= hi-phonetic), “Itrans” (= hi-itrans), “Remington” (=
  hi-remington), “Typewriter” (= hi-typewriter), and “Vedmata” (=
  hi-vedmata) in this setup tool.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s choose “Itrans” for this example.
</p>
<p>
  To add English as a second language to use at the same time, one can
  use the check box option “Add direct input” in the setup tool. If
  that option is selected, direct keyboard input is added as a second
  input method and the en_GB (British English) dictionary is added as
  a second dictionary in addition to the hi_IN dictionary.

<p>
  If more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed
  keys will be transliterated with each transliteration method and
  each transliteration result will be looked up in the enabled
  dictionaries and in the user database of previous input.
</p>
<p>
  In this screenshot, Hindi with the “hi-itrans” method <b>and</b>
  English are used at the same time.  One can see that the input
  “guru” has been typed.  The candidate list shows both “गुरु” (which is
  the transliteration of the input “guru” using the “hi-itrans”
  method) <b>and</b> the English candidates “guru” and “gurus”.  This
  is because both the transliteration “गुरु” and the direct input “guru”
  are used at the same time to lookup candidates.
</p>
<p>
  Actually it is quite rare to see candidates from both
  Hindi <b>and</b> English in a candidate list. The English word
  “guru” is a loanword from Hindi, it is just the transliteration of
  the original Hindi word into the Latin Alphabet. Therefore, the
  “Itrans” method transliterates it back to Hindi and one gets a match
  in Hindi as well. Most English words do not transliterate to
  anything meaningful in Hindi and most Hindi input does not
  match anything in English either. The example “guru” is carefully
  chosen to show how ibus-typing-booster handles multilingual input.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, as soon as one has typed a few characters, one will
  most of the time see only candidates from either Hindi or English,
  not both. I.e. the language one is typing in at the moment is
  automatically detected because one very rarely gets matches in
  the other language.
</p>
<p>
  This automatic language detection works even better after
  ibus-typing-booster has learned from user input for a while. Because
  ibus-typing-booster remembers the context where the user has typed
  words.

<p>
  This screenshot uses the same setup, Hindi (“hi-itrans”) <b>and</b>
  English. The same input “guru” has been typed and the matches
  shown in the candidate list are the same.
</p>
<p>
  The difference is that the “hi-itrans” transliteration “गुरु” is shown
  in the preëdit this time (preëdit is the current input, i.e. the
  underlined text next to the candidate list). And in the status line
  above the first candidate, one can see “hi-itrans”.
</p>
<p>
  The reason for this difference is that for this screenshot, the
  input method to be used for the preëdit has been switched to
  “hi-itrans”. 
</p>
<p>
  Switching the input method for the preëdit is sometimes necessary
  because one may not want to select any of the displayed candidates
  but commit the preëdit instead by typing a space.  For example, if
  the preëdit is currently in English mode (direct input mode) and
  one types a Hindi word, it may happen that one does not get any
  matches in the candidate list, although the word has been typed
  correctly. This may happen if this word can neither be found in the
  dictionary nor in the user database because this word has never been
  typed before by the user.  Nevertheless it may be a correct Hindi word
  of course and the user may want to commit it. But if the preëdit
  is currently in English mode, typing space would commit the Latin
  characters. So one has to switch the preëdit to “hi-itrans” first
  and then commit by typing a space.
</p>
<p>
  The key bindings to switch the input method for the preëdit are
  “Control+Down” and “Control+up”.  With only two input methods as in
  the current example, both key bindings behave the same. But there
  can be more than two input methods and then “Control+Down” moves in
  one direction through the list of input methods and “Control+Up” in
  the other direction (see <a href="">key bindings</a>).

  As an alternative to using the “Control+Down” and “Control+Up”
  key bindings, the input method for the preëdit can also be switched
  using the menu in the gnome panel. This menu also shows reminders
  for the key bindings to switch the preëdit input method.
</p>
<p>
  In the setup tool, there is an option “Remember last used preëdit
  input method”.  If that option is disabled, ibus-typing-booster will
  always use Hindi in the preëdit when you log in to your desktop and
  use ibus-typing-booster for the first time after the login. If this
  option is enabled, ibus-typing-booster will remember which input
  method was used last when you logged out of your desktop and start
  using that the next time you log in.

<p>
  This example shows using the Spanish engine of ibus-typing-booster
  with English enabled as an additional language. In the Gnome panel
  one can see “es-ES” which indicates that the Spanish version of
  ibus-typing-booster is currently selected. In the setup tool, the
  option “Add direct input” is enabled which adds support for
  (British) English.
</p>
<p>
  The input typed is “Yo soy un h” where the last character,
  the “h” is still in preëdit (marked by the underline) and we
  see some suggestions how the word starting with “h” might
  continue. 
</p>
<p>
  The suggestions shown are Spanish words, not English. This is because
  the ibus-typing-booster has already been trained by similar user input
  before. Therefore, it already knows which word starting with “h”
  the user usually types following “soy un”. And these are Spanish words.
</p>

<br class="clearboth">

<p>
  This screenshot shows how the user continues to type some English
  after finishing the Spanish sentence. The input engine has not been
  changed, one can still see the “es-ES” shown in the Gnome panel.
</p>
<p>
  The input typed is now “I am h” and again the last character “h” is still
  in preëdit and some suggestions for words starting with “h” are shown.
</p>
<p>
  This time, the suggestions for words starting with “h” are English,
  not Spanish.  This is because the words typed before were “I am” and
  the user apparently types the suggested English words frequently
  after “I am”.
</p>
<p>
  This automatic suggestion of candidates from the correct language
  according to the context makes it more efficient to use a single
  ibus-typing-booster engine for Spanish <b>and</b> English instead
  of manually switching between a Spanish and an English engine.

<h3>Multilingual setup using dconf</h3>

<p>Using the setup tool it is currently only possible to add British
English as a second language to the main language of an
ibus-typing-booster engine.</p>

<p>But internally, ibus-typing-booser already supports any combination
of input methods and dictionaries, only the setup tool is not yet able
to set this up. It can be done by setting the appropriate dconf keys
manually though.</p>

<p class="clearboth">Example:</p>

<p>Setting three input/transliteration methods:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/inputmethod '"mr-itrans,t-latn-post,NoIme"'</code></pre></p>

<p>sets the three transliteration methods, “mr-itrans” (Marathi Itrans),
“t-latn-post” (A postscript input method to type accented Latin
characters, e.g. typing “u&quot;” will produce “ü”), and “NoIme” (direct
keyboard input without any transliteration).</p>

<p>Setting 3 dictionaries:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/dictionary '"mr_IN,en_GB,de_DE"'</code></pre></p>

<p>sets the Marathi, the British English,and the German dictionary.</p>

<h2>Unicode symbols and emoji predictions</h2>

<p>
  ibus-typing-booster supports prediction of emoji and Unicode symbols
  as well (actually almost all Unicode characters except letters can
  be typed this way).  This can be enabled or disabled with the option
  “Emoji predictions” in the setup tool which is on by default.
</p>
<p>
  To make all emoji display correctly, you need good fonts which
  contain all emoji, see <a href="#emoji-fonts">Emoji fonts</a> for
  details about available fonts and font setup.

<p>
  When the emoji option is on (it is by default), you get emoji
  displayed in the candidate list automatically when typing something
  which matches an emoji.
</p>
<p>
  For example in this screenshot, the user has typed “castle”
  and the emoji 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE) is shown
  as the last candidate of the first page of the candidate list.
</p>
<p>
  If reasonable matches for emoji are found, the first match is shown
  as the last candidate of the first page of the candidate list. If
  more than one emoji has matched the input, the other matches can be
  found by scrolling down to the next page of candidates. If an emoji
  is selected and committed, it will be remembered just like
  ibus-typing-booster remembers other words and will be shown with
  higher priority next time.
</p>
<p>
  The screen shot shows coloured emoji, to make that work
  see <a href="#color-emoji">Showing emoji in colour</a>.  By default,
  emoji will be shown in black and white on current linux

<p>
  ibus-typing-booster tries to match the emoji names in a fuzzy way,
  in many cases you will get a match even if your input contains
  spelling mistakes.
</p>
<p>
  In this example, the typed input is “casle”, i.e. not spelled
  correctly. Nevertheless, one gets the match 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN
  CASTLE).

<p>
  If typing a single word does not give you the emoji you are looking
  for, you can type as many keywords as you like and concatenate them
  with underscores “_” (Or spaces “ ”. Typing space usually commits
  the preëdit, but you can insert literal spaces into the preëdit by
  typing AltGr+Space).
</p>
<p>
  In a previous example, typing “castle” gave us the match 🏰 (U+1F3F0
  EUROPEAN CASTLE). If this is not what we wanted we can type
  “castle_japanese” (or “japanese_castle”) to get 🏯 (U+1F3EF JAPANESE
  CASTLE).  Even “castlejapanese” and “japanesecastle” work in this
  case, but separating the search words with underscores or spaces
  makes it easier for the matching algorithm.

  matched the typed text well but are related to the emoji shown
  because they share keywords or categories.
</p>
<p>
  To show related emoji, click an emoji shown in the candidate list
  with the right mouse button (see <a href="#mouse-bindings">Mouse
  bindings</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Or, if you prefer to use a <a href="#key-bindings">key binding</a>
  instead of the mouse: select an emoji in the candidate list by
  moving up or down in the candidate list using the
  arrow-up/arrow-down keys or the page-up/page-down keys until the
  desired emoji is highlighted, then press AltGr+F12.
</p>
<p>
  AltGr+F12 is the key binding to “lookup related stuff”. If you press
  this while no candidate is selected, a lookup of related stuff for
  the preëdit is tried. In this case, the preëdit contains the text
  “castle” which is not an emoji. So no related emoji will be
  found. But if NLTK is used, related words for “castle” may be shown,
  see <a href="#related-words-nltk">Using NLTK to find related
  words</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As seen in the screen shot, looking up related emoji for the
  “Japanese castle” gives us emoji for other types of castles or
  buildings. The lists of words shown in square brackets are the
  keywords the shown emoji have in common with the originally selected
  emoji. By typing the “Escape” key, one can go back to the original
  list.

  In this example, the German typing booster is used with English

  “castle” or the German word for castle “Schloss” to find castle
  emoji.
</p>
<p>
  In the screen shot, the input typed is “Schloss_europa” and the
  emoji matches shown are 🏰 (U+1F3F0 EUROPEAN CASTLE), 🔒 (U+1F512
  LOCK), and 🏯 (U+1F3EF JAPANESE CASTLE).
</p>
<p>
  The German word “Schloss” can mean “castle” as well as “lock”.
  Therefore, the padlock emoji 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK) matches as well.

  Let’s look up related emoji by clicking the candidate number 5,
  “Geschlossenes Schloss” 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK) with the right mouse button
  (See <a href="#emoji-related">Looking up related Emoji</a>).
</p>
<p>
  We get several variants of padlock emoji, the European castle
  and some closed mailboxes because “geschlossen” in German can also
  mean “closed”.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, the related emoji shown in the screen shot have German
  names and keywords. That’s because this example uses German as the
  main language for ibus-typing-booster with English as a second
  language (See <a href="#multilingual-input">Multilingual input</a>).
  When looking up related emoji, they are shown in all languages
  ibus-typing-booster is setup to use, but they are sorted in the
  order of preference of the languages. So German is on top because it
  is the main language. To see emoji whose English keywords are
  related to the emoji 🔒 (U+1F512 LOCK), one can scroll further down
  in the candidate list. These are of course labelled in English.

<h4>Emoji input using Japanese</h4>

<p>
  To be able to input emoji using their Japanese names, one first
  needs to install the
  packages <code>m17n-db-extras</code>, <code>m17n-lib-anthy</code>
  and <code>anthy</code> on Fedora. On Fedora one can do this using
  the command:
</p>
<p>
<code>sudo dnf install m17n-db-extras m17n-lib-anthy</code>
</p>
<p>
  This should work on other distributions as well, but the package names
  may be different. You need the package which contains the
  <code>/usr/share/m17n/ja-anthy.mim</code> file and other packages
  which are required to make the ja-anthy input method of the m17n
  library work.
</p>
<p>
  Then one needs to add the ja-anthy input method and the Japanese
  dictionary to the setup of ibus typing booster.  For details
  see <a href="#multilingual-setup-dconf">Multilingual setup using
  dconf</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Which language version version of ibus-typing-booster is used does not
  matter here. Let’s assume we are using the American English typing booster.
  You may first want to check which dictionaries and input methods are already
  setup:
</p>
<p>
  <code>dconf dump /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-en-us/</code>
</p>
<p>
  Look at the contents of the <code>inputmethod</code> and <code>dictionary</code>
  keys. Then add <code>ja-anthy</code> and <code>ja_JP</code> in addition
  to what was already there. For example like this:
</p>
<p>
  <code>dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-en-us/inputmethod '"NoIme,ja-anthy"'</code>
</p>
<p>
  “NoIme” means “no input method”, which means direct keyboard input.
</p>
<p>
  <code>dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-en-us/dictionary '"ja_JP,en_US"'</code>  
</p>
<p>
  Here I did put the <code>ja-anthy</code> input method at second
  priority and the <code>ja_JP</code> dictionary at first priority.

<p>
  Now one can type emoji keywords using Japanese. For example when
  typing “katasumuri” (which means “snail”), one gets the emoji 🐌
  (U+1F40C SNAIL) listed as a candidate.
</p>
<p>
  It is labelled in the candidate list in Japanese hiragan syllables,
  i.e. “かたつむり”. The Latin “katatsumuri” was transliterated by the
  ja-anthy input method to “かたつむり” and this was then looked up in
  the  dictionaries. The Latin text “katatsumuri” was of course
  looked up as well but of course produced no match.

<p>
  That makes no difference for the matches, still both “katatsumuri”
  and “かたつむり” are looked up in the dictionaries. Only when

  hiragana “かたつむり”.

  keywords in hiragana (They share the keyword “むし” = “mushi” which
  means insect.

  will be emoji which are related because they share keywords in

<h3>Unicode symbol input</h3>

<p>
  Using the emoji input mode of ibus-typing-booster, one cannot only
  input emoji but other Unicode symbols as well. Actually almost all
  Unicode characters can be typed this way (Except most letters,
  because letters can usually typed much faster directly).

<p>
  This screenshot shows how the emoji mode can be used to input
  mathematical symbols. You can also combine keywords using “_”,

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The emoji mode of ibus-typing-booster can also be used to input
  any character using hexadezimal Unicode code points.
</p>
<p>
  To be able to input hexadecimal numbers without problems, the option
  “Use digits as select keys” should be switched off in the setup
  tool. If this option were switched on, typing a digit like “1” would
  select the candidate with the number one instead of inserting the
  digit “1” into the preëdit.
</p>
<p>
  If the option “Use digits as select keys” is switched off, one
  can still use the F1-F9 keys to select candidates (and of course
  one can select candidates with the mouse).
</p>
<p>
  In this example, “100” has been typed and one gets the matches 💯
  U+1F4AF HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL which is an emoji which has been
  matched because of its alternative name “100” and Ā U+0100 LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON which has been matched because it has
  the Unicode code point 100 (hexadezimal).
</p>
<p>
  It is quite rare that typing a Unicode code point matches an emoji
  as well.  There will never be many candidates when typing Unicode
  code points.

    </td>
  </tr>

<p>
  When emoji mode is on, finding the matching candidates can be
  considerably slower compared to when emoji mode is switched off.
  Especially if the emoji lookup is done in multiple languages at the
  same time. In this case, there may be a noticeable delay until
  the candidate list pops up.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, one may want to switch emoji mode off for maximum speed.
</p>
<p>
  Always opening the setup tool to switch emoji mode on if one
  occasionally wants to input an emoji would be inconvenient.
  Therefore, emoji mode can also be toggled with
  a <a href="mouse-bindings">mouse binding</a> (Control+Button3
  anywhere in the candidate list toogles emoji mode between on and
  off) or with a <a href="#key-bindings">key binding</a> (AltGr+F6
  toggles emoji mode between on and off).
</p>
<p>
  But there is an even faster way to temporarily switch on emoji mode
  just for the current lookup.
</p>
<p>
  In this screenshot we can see that emoji mode is off because the
  box to the left of the smiley above the candidate list is not
  checked (and one can see that “Unicode symbols and emoji
  predictions” is not checked in the setup tool either).
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless we get matches for two camel emoji. This is because the
  input typed is “camel_” which contains a trailing underscore.
  Trailing and leading underscores temporarily turn on emoji mode
  just for this one lookup.

<br class="clearboth">
<a name="emoji-fonts"></a>
<br>
<h3>Emoji fonts</h3>

<p>
  A good black and white font for emoji is
  the <a href="http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/">Symbola</a> font by
  George Douros. Best use the latest version, at least the version
  updated for Unicode 9.0.0.  On Fedora and openSUSE, this font is in
  the “gdouros-symbola-fonts” package. Fedora 25 already has the
  Unicode 9.0.0 version. If you are using Fedora 24, better update
  that font.
</p>
<p>
  To make sure that “Symbola” is your preferred font for emoji, you
  can use a fontconfig setup
  file <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> as in
  this <a href="fonts.conf">example fonts.conf file</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not yet have a <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>
  file, create one with the contents as above. If you already have such
  a file but no “alias” settings exist, add the part defining the aliases.
  Or if you already have “alias” settings in your
  <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> file, edit them.
</p>
<p>
  “DejaVu Serif”, “DejaVu Sans”, and “DejaVu Sans Mono”, are just
  examples, put your favorite fonts for Latin and other
  scripts <b>below</b> the fonts for emoji in
  the <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> setup file.
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t give a good emoji font like “Symbola” the highest
  priority in the fontconfig setup, the highest priority font may be a
  font which already has some emoji. For example, “DejaVu Sans”
  already has many emoji, but not all. I.e. when “DejaVu Sans” has
  highest priority and is tried first, all emoji which are available
  in “DejaVu Sans” are shown using that font and only those which are
  missing in “DejaVu Sans” are shown using the “Symbola” font.  That
  means you will see the some emoji displayed using the “DejaVu Sans”
  font and some using the “Symbola” font which will look a bit
  inconsistent. It looks nicer using “Symbola” for all emoji
  which can be achieved by giving “Symbola” the highest priority.
</p>
<p>
  The Latin characters in the “Symbola” font are with serifs and not
  really suitable to be used as a default Latin font. Nevertheless,
  putting “Symbola” with top priority into
  the <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> setup file does
  usually not cause any problems.
</p>
<p>
  Your desktop, editor, terminal, … will most likely set some other font
  anyway.  For example, the Gnome3 desktop usually sets the “Cantarell”
  font, i.e. Gnome3 will still use “Cantarell” even if you give the
  “Symbola” font highest priority
  in <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> (You can change the
  font used for the Gnome3 desktop with <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code>.
  The same is true for most other desktops and programs.
</p>

<h4>Showing emoji in colour</h4>

<p>
  To show emoji in colour,
  an <a href="http://www.hadess.net/2016/05/blog-backlog-post-1-emoji.html">experimental
  patch for cairo</a> and a suitable font is needed.
</p>
<p>
  Cairo packages for Fedora containing that experimental patch are available
  <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/hadess/emoji/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  One font which can be used to show emoji in colour is “Noto Color
  Emoji” (“NotoColorEmoji.ttf”).  On Fedora, this font is in the
  “google-noto-emoji-fonts” package.  Or you can get
  it <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Another font which has emoji in colour is the “Emoji One” font
  (“emojione-android.ttf”).  It is available
  <a href="https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/raw/master/assets/fonts/emojione-android.ttf">here</a>. If you want a Fedora package you can also get this font from
  <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/hadess/emoji/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To make the colour emoji fonts your default emoji fonts, you can use a
  fontconfig setup file <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> as in
  this <a href="fonts.conf">example fonts.conf file</a> and edit it a bit.
</p>
<p>
  This <a href="fonts.conf">example fonts.conf file</a> gives
  “Symbola” the highest priority, which is a good black and white
  emoji font.  That means if you use
  a <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> file exactly as in
  this example, the emoji will display in black and white.  If you
  want coloured emoji, change that setup file to put either “Noto
  Color Emoji” or “Emoji One” on top, whichever you prefer.
</p>
<p>
  Without the hacks to show emoji in colour, the emoji support in
  ibus-typing-booster will still work but the emoji will be displayed
  in black and white.
