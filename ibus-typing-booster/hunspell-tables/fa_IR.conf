# “m17n_mim_name” selects the default input method. Omit this key or
# set it to the the special value “NoIme” to use no input method
# by default. If a keyboard layout is available which has all
# needed characters, no input method is necessary and using
# the keyboard layout directly might be more convenient.

# Format is a comma separated list of
#   <Display Name>:<Input Method>
# values. “Display Name” is the text which should be presented to the
# user in the menu to select the input method, “Input Method” is the
# name of the input method as libtranslit needs it to load the input method.
# There is one special value “NoIme” for “Input Method”, this value
# means “Do not use any m17n transliteration at all, use the characters
# as they are produced by the keyboard layout directly without any
# transliteration.
#
# Attention: when using the m17n input method “fa-isiri” to simulate
# the Persian keyboard, the Eastern Arabic numerals ۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹۰ cannot
# be typed because “fa-isiri” produces these by transliterating 1234567890
# and these cannot be added to the list of valid input characters because
# this would prevent selecting between the suggested candidates.
