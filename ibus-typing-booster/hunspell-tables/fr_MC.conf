# “m17_mim_name” selects the default input method. Omit this key or
# set it to the the special value “NoIme” to use no input method
# by default. If a keyboard layout is available which has all
# needed characters, no input method is necessary and using
# the keyboard layout directly might be more convenient.

# “other_ime” should be set to TRUE if the user should be able to select
# between different possible input methods for the language.

# “imes” lists the possible input methods.
# Format is a comma separated list of
#   <Display Name>:<Input Method>
# values. “Display Name” is the text which should be presented to the
# user in the menu to select the input method, “Input Method” is the
# name of the input method as libtranslit needs it to load the input method.
# There is one special value “NoIme” for “Input Method”, this value
# means “Do not use any m17n transliteration at all, use the characters
# as they are produced by the keyboard layout directly without any
# transliteration.
#
# Attention: using the simulated Azerty keyboard from m17n
# for French is probably not a good idea. Because the 0123456789
# keys need to be valid input keys then (for example '2' is transliterated to
# 'é'. But if the number keys are valid input chars, they cannot be used
# to select one of the suggested candidates anymore.
# So better set other_ime=False for French and only use the native
# keyboard.
