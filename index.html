<p>ibus-typing-booster is a completion input method to speedup typing.</p>

Developer is Yu Yuwei <a href="mailto:acevery@gmail.com">acevery@gmail.com</a>, with contributions from

<td>Same as F1-F9 if the option “Use digits as select keys” is enabled. This makes selecting candidates a bit easier because the number keys 1-9 are closer to the fingers then F1-F9 on most keyboards. On the other hand, it makes completing when typing numbers impossible and it makes typing strings which are combinations of letters and numbers like “A4” more difficult. If digits are used as select keys, numbers can only be typed when no candidate list is shown. In most cases this means that numbers can only be typed when nothing else has been typed yet and the preëdit is empty.</td>

<a id="multilingual-input" class="anchor" href="#multilingual-input" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multilingual input</h1>

<p>ibus-typing-booster supports using more than one input
method/transliteration at the same time.</p>

<p>For example, if one uses the ibus-typing-booster engine “mr-IN”,
i.e. the engine for the Indian language Marathi, one can select one of
the Marathi input methods mr-itrans, mr-phonetic, mr-inscript, and
mr-inscript2 in the setup tool. Keys typed will be transliterated
using the selected transliteration method and looked up in the mr_IN
hunspell dictionary and the user database of previous input.</p>

<p>To add English as a second language to use at the same time, one can
use the checkbox option “Add direct input” in the setup tool. If that
option is selected, direct keyboard input is added as a second input
method and the en_GB (British English) dictionary is added as a second
dictionary in addition to the mr_IN dictionary.</p>

<p>If more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed
keys will will be transliterated with each transliteration
method and each result will be looked up in the enabled dictionaries
and in the user database of previous input.</p>

<p>That way, to type English, one does not have to switch off the Marathi
engine of ibus-typing-booster, one can just type and suitable English
candidates will show up as well in the candidate list. After typing a
few characters, Marathi input is unlikely to match English candidates
and English input is unlikely to match Marathi candidates. This works
even better after ibus-typing-booster has learned a while from the
user input because ibus-typing-booster tries to complete the currently
typed word by also using the last few words typed before as additional
information. Therefore, if the user types a combination of words again
he has already typed previously, the prediction for the currently
typed word will be much better.</p>

<p>Using the setup tool it is currently only possible to add British
English as a second language to the main language of an
ibus-typing-booster engine.</p>

<p>But internally, ibus-typing-booser already supports any combination
of input methods and dictionaries, only the setup tool is not
yet able to set this up. It can be done by setting the
appropriate dconf keys manually though.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Setting three input/transliteration methods:</p>

<p><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/inputmethod '"mr-itrans,t-latn-post,NoIme"'</code></p>

<p>sets the three transliteration methods, “mr-itrans” (Marathi Itrans),
“t-latn-post” (A postscript input method to type accented Latin
characters, e.g. typing “u"” will produce “ü”), and “NoIme” (direct
keyboard input without any transliteration).</p>

<p>Setting 3 dictionaries:</p>

<p><code>$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/dictionary='"mr_IN,en_GB,de_DE"'</code></p>

<p>sets the Marathi, the British English,and the German dictionary.</p>
