  "body": "# Introduction\r\nibus-typing-booster is a completion input method to speedup typing.\r\n\r\nOriginally it was forked from ibus-table whose Project Owner &\r\nDeveloper is Yu Yuwei <acevery@gmail.com>, with contributions from\r\nCaius \"kaio\" Chance <cchance@redhat.com>.\r\n\r\nDevelopers:\r\n* Mike FABIAN <mfabian@redhat.com>\r\n* Anish Patil <anish.developer@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n# Key Bindings\r\nKey combination|Effect\r\n---------------|------\r\nSpace|Commit the preëdit and send a space to the application, i.e. commit the typed string followed by a space.\r\nReturn|Commit the preëdit and send a Return to the application.\r\nEnter|Commit the preëdit and send a Enter to the application.\r\nTab|If the option “Enable suggestions by Tab key” is *not* set: “Tab” behaves like “Space”, i.e. it commits the typed string followed by a space. If the option “Enable suggestions by Tab key” is set: “Tab” toggles the display of the candidate list. I.e. it shows the candidate list if it was hidden and hides the candidate list if it was shown.\r\nEscape|Clear preëdit and discard contents.\r\nLeft  (Arrow left)|Move cursor one typed key left in the preëdit text. May trigger a commit if the left end of the preëdit is reached.\r\nControl+Left|Move cursor to the left end of the preëdit text. If the cursor is already at the left end of the preëdit text, trigger a commit and send a Control+Left to the application.\r\nRight (Arrow right)|Move cursor one typed key right in preëdit text. May trigger a commit if the right end of the preëdit is reached.\r\nControl+Right|Move cursor to the right end of the preëdit text. If the cursor is already at the right end of the preëdit text, trigger a commit and send a Control+Right to the application.\r\nBackspace|Remove the typed key to the left of the cursor in the preëdit text.\r\nControl+Backspace|Remove everything to the left of the cursor in the preëdit text.\r\nDelete|Remove the typed key to the right of the cursor in the preëdit text.\r\nControl+Delete|Remove everything to the right of the cursor in the preëdit text.\r\nDown  (Arrow down)|Select the next candidate.\r\nUp    (Arrow up)|Select the previous candidate.\r\nPage_Up|Show next page of candidates.\r\nPage_Down|Show previous page of candidates.\r\nF1|Commit the candidate with the label “1”\r\nF2|Commit the candidate with the label “2”\r\n...|...\r\nF9|Commit the candidate with the label “9”\r\n1-9|Same as F1-F9 if the option “Use digits as select keys” is enabled. This makes selecting candidates a bit easier because the number keys 1-9 are closer to the fingers then F1-F9 on most keyboards. On the other hand, it makes completing when typing numbers impossible and it makes typing strings which are combinations of letters and numbers like “A4” more difficult. If digits are used as select keys, numbers can only be typed when no candidate list is shown. In most cases this means that numbers can only be typed when nothing else has been typed yet and the preëdit is empty.\r\n\r\nWhen more than one input method at the same time is used:\r\n\r\nKey combination|Effect\r\n---------------|------\r\nControl+Down|Switch input method used for the preëdit to the next input method\r\nControl+Up|Switch input method used for the preëdit to the previous input method.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Multilingual input\r\n\r\nibus-typing-booster supports using more than one input\r\nmethod/transliteration at the same time.\r\n\r\nFor example, if one uses the ibus-typing-booster engine “mr-IN”,\r\ni.e. the engine for the Indian language Marathi, one can select one of\r\nthe Marathi input methods mr-itrans, mr-phonetic, mr-inscript, and\r\nmr-inscript2 in the setup tool. Keys typed will be transliterated\r\nusing the selected transliteration method and looked up in the mr_IN\r\nhunspell dictionary and the user database of previous input.\r\n\r\nTo add English as a second language to use at the same time, one can\r\nuse the checkbox option “Add direct input” in the setup tool. If that\r\noption is selected, direct keyboard input is added as a second input\r\nmethod and the en_GB (British English) dictionary is added as a second\r\ndictionary in addition to the mr_IN dictionary.\r\n\r\nIf more than one input/transliteration method is enabled, the typed\r\nkeys will will be transliterated with each transliteration\r\nmethod and each result will be looked up in the enabled dictionaries\r\nand in the user database of previous input.\r\n\r\nThat way, to type English, one does not have to switch off the Marathi\r\nengine of ibus-typing-booster, one can just type and suitable English\r\ncandidates will show up as well in the candidate list. After typing a\r\nfew characters, Marathi input is unlikely to match English candidates\r\nand English input is unlikely to match Marathi candidates. This works\r\neven better after ibus-typing-booster has learned a while from the\r\nuser input because ibus-typing-booster tries to complete the currently\r\ntyped word by also using the last few words typed before as additional\r\ninformation. Therefore, if the user types a combination of words again\r\nhe has already typed previously, the prediction for the currently\r\ntyped word will be much better.\r\n\r\nUsing the setup tool it is currently only possible to add British\r\nEnglish as a second language to the main language of an\r\nibus-typing-booster engine.\r\n\r\nBut internally, ibus-typing-booser already supports any combination\r\nof input methods and dictionaries, only the setup tool is not\r\nyet able to set this up. It can be done by setting the\r\nappropriate dconf keys manually though.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nSetting three input/transliteration methods:\r\n\r\n`$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/inputmethod '\"mr-itrans,t-latn-post,NoIme\"'`\r\n\r\nsets the three transliteration methods, “mr-itrans” (Marathi Itrans),\r\n“t-latn-post” (A postscript input method to type accented Latin\r\ncharacters, e.g. typing “u\"” will produce “ü”), and “NoIme” (direct\r\nkeyboard input without any transliteration).\r\n\r\nSetting 3 dictionaries:\r\n\r\n`$ dconf write /desktop/ibus/engine/typing-booster/typing-booster-mr-in/dictionary='\"mr_IN,en_GB,de_DE\"'`\r\n\r\nsets the Marathi, the British English,and the German dictionary.\r\n",
